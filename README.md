## Analysis:
Using Tableau, I created a dynamic dashboard to visually explore these factors I focused on factors like show type, genre, country, release year, rating, duration.found that some genres,in various countries, like documentaries and stand up comedy, are consistently popular worldwide, while others, like drama, are region-specific. I also explored how newer content tends to get more attention and how ratings play a big role in keeping viewers engaged. When it comes to duration, I found that shorter shows, like movies, tend to attract more viewers than longer ones, like TV series.

## Conclusion:
The analysis revealed that documentaries and stand up comedy are the most popular genres globally, with newer content and higher-rated shows driving higher engagement. Shorter formats like movies outperform longer series in terms of views.
